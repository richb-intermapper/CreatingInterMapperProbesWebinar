\GB\Parameter Test Probe\P\

This probe shows the various data types that can be used as parameters to a custom probe. It shows these parameter values in the Status Window as well.

It also sets the device status based on the setting of the dropdown.

</description>

-- Parameters are user-settable values that the probe uses for its comparisons.
-- Specify the default values here. The customer can change them and they will be retained for each device.

<parameters>
	"Text"										= 	"Text Value"
	"Password*"									= 	""
	"Check Me[true,false]"						=	"true"
	"Five Choices[OK,Warn,Alarm,Critical,Down]"	=	"OK"
</parameters>

-- SNMP values to be retrieved from the device, and 
-- Specify the variable name, its OID, a format (usually DEFAULT) and a short description.
-- CALCULATION variables are computed from other values already retrieved from the device.

    down: (${Five Choices[OK,Warn,Alarm,Critical,Down]} == "Down")  	"It's Down!"

   alarm: (${Five Choices[OK,Warn,Alarm,Critical,Down]} == "Alarm")  	"It's in Alarm!"
 warning: (${Five Choices[OK,Warn,Alarm,Critical,Down]} == "Warn")  	"It's in Warn!"
